el-fast-filelist.el --- Fast file access for given folder

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Useful when you'd like to have handy access to files in specific folder.
I personally use it to access cheatsheets on variuos subjects.
Let's say I need to remind myself how to configure gradient background in css,
(thing I've noted before). With help of this script I open my cheatsheet file
with  "<prefix> c" and typing "css".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put following projects (see my page on github) within your load path:
el-kit into 'el-kit' folder
el-index into 'el-index' folder

Put `el-fast-filelist' project into 'el-fast-filelist' folder in your load path
